# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning
## Kaggle Competition Leaderboard: 78th  / 978 teams (Top 8%)

 ### Introduction
This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information related to airline, class, number of stops, departure and arrival times, source and destination, duration, and the number of days left for departure.

### Objective
The objective is to build a robust regression model capable of accurately estimating flight prices for unseen test data, which can assist in travel cost estimation and pricing strategies.

### Tools & Techniques
The code utilizes Python libraries such as **pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib**, and **seaborn** for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. Feature transformation methods include **One-Hot Encoding, Target Encoding,** and **Standardization**. Multiple models are implemented including **Linear Regression, Ridge & Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, XGBoost, and LightGBM.**

### Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is evaluated using:
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** Indicates the average prediction error magnitude.
- **R-squared (R²):** Reflects how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

These metrics guide the selection of the most effective model for final predictions.
